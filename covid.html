    <p><br> COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound global impact, with over 3 billion reported cases affecting nearly 20% of the world's population. This highlights the widespread nature of the virus and its ability to spread rapidly across continents. Tragically, the virus claimed the lives of nearly 29 million individuals, resulting in a mortality rate of 0.90%. It is evident that a clear trend of increasing cases from the beginning of 2020 until mid-2023 is seen which is followed by a decline leading into 2024. This suggests that efforts to control the spread of the virus may have started to yield results by reducing the number of new infections. Notably, the Population vs Infection bar chart highlighted Europe as the region most affected in proportion to its population.
