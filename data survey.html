    <p><br> <br>According to visualization, 630 individuals participated in the survey. Most of whom were young adults and resident of USA. The visualization revealed that male data analysts emerged as the highest-earning professionals among the participants. Interestingly, a majority of individuals expressed dissatisfaction with their current salary. This underscores the importance of fair compensation and the need for organizations to reassess their salary structures to align with industry standards and employee expectations. Approximately half of the participants deemed their work/life balance as unsatisfactory. This indicates a potential area of concern for employers, emphasizing the need to implement policies and practices that promote employee well-being and improve work/life balance.
